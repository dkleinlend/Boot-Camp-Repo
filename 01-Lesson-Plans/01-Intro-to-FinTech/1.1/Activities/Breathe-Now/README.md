# Breathe Now

In this activity, you will work in groups to define
and articulate the challenges faced by a company called Breathe Now, a ventilator rental company. You will then pitch a solution to Breathe Now based on your groupâ€™s brainstorm.

## Instructions

### The Clint
Breathe Now is a charity organization that builds, rents, and maintains ventilators. Its mission is to supply ventilators for hospitals to meet peak demand across the world. Some hospitals need tens of thousands of ventilators in a peak demand event. The rest of the time they may only need a dozen. Breathe Now maintains an inventory of about 50,000 ventilators it distributes across the world, repairing and moving them as needed.

### The Situation
Breathe Now has a great mission and lots of buzz, but no plan to execute. While they received a lot of initial orders, they have no clear system to determine how many ventilators to send to each hospital, with the demand exceeding the supply. In addition, the need of ventilators fluctuates at each hospital. When the patient volume changes, Breathe Now does not have a plan to move the ventilators from one hospital to another. The majority of the ventilators end up staying at the initial hospital, some of which are not actively used. 15% of the ventilators were returned to Breathe Now. The rest of the ventilators were sent from one hospital to another. As a result, Breathe Now is losing track of inventory, and replacement parts are going to the wrong places. Breathe Now is on the brink of collapse!

### Your Mission
Breathe Now has asked your group to analyze their key problem areas and offer potential solutions to their problems.

In your groups, you will:

- Discuss the 5 key problems facing Breathe Now (see next section).
- Brainstorm potential solutions.
- Give a quick pitch of your analysis and solutions to Breathe Now (aka, the rest of the class).

### 5 Key Problems
- How can Breathe Now determine how many ventilators to send to each hospital?
- How can Breathe Now manage the fluctuations of needs at each hospital?
- How can Breathe Now track the movement of the ventilators from one location to another?
- How can the hospitals loan surplus inventory to other local quarantine sites and keep track of the equipments?
- What can Breathe Now quantify the impact of their organization?

With your group, analyze these 5 key areas and identify the technical and financial challenges associated with each problem. Be ready to pitch potential solutions to Breathe Now!
